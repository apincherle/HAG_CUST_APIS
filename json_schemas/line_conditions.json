    "$comment": "Line conditions take one of two forms; a) bound to 1-many stamps or, b) global line conditions. As such, you would reasonably expect each document to have either a stamps field OR a global set to true.\n\nThe schema for this collection deviates from the Mongo Design Principles in that it does not have an access array. The justification for this is that access is defined either by the parent organisation (held in the organisation field) or by global being set to true. Therefore, an access array would present duplicate, highly volatile, data.",
